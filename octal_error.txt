	/*Eliminate leading zeroes on decimal literals. Why? Because a leading zero indicates an octal. This line will not compile because 9 is not an octal digit.
	*Like our "normal" numbers are base 10 (or radix 10) because we have 10 different digits (from the 0 to the 9):

	*the octals numbers include only the representations for the values from 0 to 7:
