With the completion of my pong game I have some specific goals I would like to accomplish when it comes to developing programs and games. 


By the end of 2020 I want to complete:

Five small scale projects.
Two larger scale projects.

I want to start my small scale projects in Python, develop 3 python games. I am going to attempt to develop these games unassisted.
2 out of the 5 projects I will complete will be done in Java, to familiarize myself with the programming language for my next class. 

My two large scale projects, one will by done in python, the other in java. 

I have an idea for my larger scale project. A free minecraft clone, for mobile devices and for PC.

Call it  either freecraft or battlecraft... Battleblocks? freeblocks.


I want to throw in a bonus project, considering I have completed my first ever pong tutorial using turtle I want to try to use pygame instead


Here is a check list of tasks I will accomplish:

1. Pygame Pong -Pongition-(Implement my own cool features, actual 3d type graphics)
2. Text adventure game (Java)
3. Roguelike dungeon crawler (Python)
4. Space shooter (Java)
5. Puzzle based game like puyo (Python)
6. Java pong


7. Minecraft clone in python (maybe java)
8. Classic Platformer like Sonic
9. Brick breaker game
