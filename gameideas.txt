Had a funny idea for a game.

"Don't kill eachother simulator"

Pretty much the person who wins the game will have the least amount of kills. 

Purely death match with no teams. 

Biggest KD lowest on leader board.

Leader board balance out by KD/Score/Time played.

Maybe ways to get points by destroying eachothers property??? or maybe making friends. Not sure yet.
